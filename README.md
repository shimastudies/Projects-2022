# Projects-2022
Any projects relating to web development like html, css, javascript, etc. I'll be working with courses/boot camps from Udemy or Youtube tutorial as well as making my own starter project. This is level one for me. This is my first HTML webpage that I'm working on as of the last week of March and into June. In order to create notes for a biology class. But the goal is to be able to make it turn it into a fully functional web page for other students to use as study material for educational purposes.
